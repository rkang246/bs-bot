BS, also known as the PG variants of Liar, Cheat, I-Doubt-It, Bluff, and Bologna, is a card game where the goal is to get rid of all your cards before anyone else.

This java app is a simple bot that suggests your next move given the number of players, cards in your hand, and next card you should be playing.

# What this bot can do:
- sort your hand based on the order the cards will be played, rather than card value.
- suggest the next card(s) you should place.

# What this bot will not do:
- tell you when to call "BS".
- compensate for your terrible poker face.

# TO-DO:
- A lot of bug fixin'
